# Sprint 2025-02: UX Refinement

## A. Overview

The outline for UX improvements to achieve "Claude Code feel" with ingredients like tight feedback, clean focus, implicit context awareness, motion, and color hierarchy.

Actionable quick-win layers:

1. Progress bars on long-running ops
2. Smart truncation + expandable previews
3. Color-coded status icons (success = green, warn = yellow, error = red)
4. Cognitive grouping
5. Define a ui/colors.ts and centralize chalk
6. Create services/ui-state.ts → central event bus for indexer / compactor updates
7. Add events in WorkspaceIndexer and TokenCounter to broadcast progress

## B. Objectives

- Improve perceived intelligence by +40%
- Reduce support load by –30%
- Double retention, especially for daily coders
- 90 % of testers can explain "what Grok is aware of"

## C. Scope

Mini UX Sprint: 5 days

Deliverables: Terminal status bar, progress indicators, color-coded output, real-time updates, startup banner + context tooltip

## D. Timeline

5 days

## E. Daily Tasks

Day 1: Progress bars in CLI ops → progress visible, 0 user confusion on "is it doing something?"

Day 2: Smart truncation + expandable previews → information density without overwhelm

Day 3: Cognitive grouping + colors → visual hierarchy and clarity

Day 4: Event bus + indexer events → real-time updates without polling

Day 5: Startup banner + context tooltip → Context visible, users know what’s in scope

## F. Success Metrics

- Perceived intelligence ≈ +40 %
- Support load ≈ –30 %
- Retention likely doubles (especially for daily coders)

## G. Risks and Mitigation

- Implementation challenges: Ensure the event bus integrates well with existing indexer and compactor.
- Time constraints: Focus on quick-wins.
- Testing: Test with real users to validate the 90% transparency.
