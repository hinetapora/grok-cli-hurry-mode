# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Grok CLI

Welcome, fellow developer! You're about to embark on a journey that will transform how you interact with your terminal. Grok CLI isn't just another command-line toolâ€”it's your AI-powered coding companion.

## Why Grok CLI?

Traditional terminal workflows often require memorizing countless commands, flags, and syntax variations. Grok CLI changes this paradigm by letting you express your intentions in natural language while maintaining the power and precision developers need.

**Instead of this:**
```bash
find . -name "*.js" -type f | xargs grep -l "useEffect" | head -10
```

**You can simply say:**
```bash
grok "show me the first 10 JavaScript files that use useEffect"
```

## Core Philosophy

**Conversational by Design**
- Natural language commands that understand context
- No need to memorize complex syntax
- Intelligent suggestions and error recovery

**Developer-Centric**
- Built for real development workflows
- Integrates with existing tools and processes
- Respects your project structure and conventions

**Extensible and Powerful**
- 15+ specialized tools for different tasks
- MCP integration for external services
