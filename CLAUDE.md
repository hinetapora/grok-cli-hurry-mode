# Grok CLI - CLAUDE.md

This document provides context for Claude Code to help improve this Grok CLI application to be as feature-rich and capable as Claude Code itself.

## Project Overview

Grok CLI is a conversational AI CLI tool that brings Grok's capabilities directly into the terminal. It features an intelligent agent system with tool usage, file operations, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components

- **Agent System** (`src/agent/grok-agent.ts`): Central orchestration with streaming, tool execution, and conversation management
- **Grok Client** (`src/grok/client.ts`): OpenAI-compatible API client for X.AI's Grok models
- **Tool System** (`src/tools/`): Modular tools for file operations, bash execution, search, and more
- **UI Components** (`src/ui/`): Ink-based terminal interface with chat history and input handling
- **MCP Integration** (`src/mcp/`): Model Context Protocol support for extending capabilities
- **Settings Management** (`src/utils/settings-manager.ts`): User and project-level configuration

## Claude Code Feature Parity Goals

The ultimate goal is to match Claude Code's capabilities in:
- **Code Understanding**: Deep semantic analysis of codebases
- **Multi-file Operations**: Complex refactoring across multiple files
- **Context Awareness**: Maintaining understanding of project structure
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with development tools
- **User Experience**: Intuitive and efficient interaction patterns

This CLI aims to bring the power of Claude Code to terminal-based workflows while maintaining the flexibility and extensibility that makes it unique.

## ðŸ“š Documentation System Workflow

### Before Planning Features:
1. **Read `.agent/README.md`** for project overview
2. **Check `.agent/system/`** for architecture context
3. **Review `.agent/tasks/`** for related work
4. **Scan `.agent/sop/`** for established patterns

### During Implementation:
- Store PRDs in `.agent/tasks/` before coding
- Reference architecture docs for consistency
- Follow established patterns from SOPs
- Use cross-references between .agent docs

### After Implementation:
- **ALWAYS use smart push**: `git pushup` or `npm run smart-push` (never `git push origin main`)
- Run `/update-agent-docs` to capture changes  
- Update `.agent/system/` if architecture changed
- Add new SOPs for repeatable processes
- Link related tasks and documents

### Documentation Rules:
- Keep system docs as single source of truth
- Use relative links between .agent documents  
- Maintain concise, actionable content
- Update cross-references when adding new docs

### Token Optimization:
- Read .agent docs hierarchically (README â†’ critical-state â†’ relevant docs)
- Expect ~600 tokens for full context vs 3000+ without system
- Use .agent structure to avoid redundant codebase scanning
- Reference existing documentation rather than recreating context
